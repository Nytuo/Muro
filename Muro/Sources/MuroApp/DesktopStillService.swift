/// Keeps the real macOS desktop picture in step with the wallpaper Muro is
/// playing, so there is always a still of the right wallpaper underneath the
/// video.
///
/// **Why this exists.** Muro never told macOS anything about what it plays.
/// The video lives in a borderless window of Muro's own, seated just under the
/// desktop icons, and the desktop picture underneath it stayed whatever it had
/// been. Quit Muro, or let it be killed, and that window goes with it: the
/// user is left looking at a picture they replaced weeks ago, or at nothing.
/// On macOS 15 and earlier it also cost the menu bar its colour, because the
/// menu bar takes its tint from the desktop picture and never saw the video.
/// That tint report, on r/MacOS on 2026-08-30, is where this started.
///
/// So every apply, every playlist step and every automation step writes a
/// still frame of the wallpaper as the actual desktop picture. Muro's video
/// covers it while Muro runs, and when Muro is not running the same image is
/// still there. It used to be switched off on macOS 26 and later, which is why
/// quitting Muro on a modern Mac left a black desktop.
///
/// **The one screen it will not touch.** macOS keeps a single wallpaper per
/// display and a lock-screen apply puts Muro's extension on it. Writing a
/// desktop picture there would throw the lock screen away, so those screens
/// are left alone and the extension is handed the still instead, through
/// `LockScreenService.publishDesktopStill`, to draw itself.
///
/// Everything it writes outside Muro's own folders is one thing, the desktop
/// picture, and the user's own picture is read and kept before it is touched
/// so it can be put back. `SECURITY.md` discloses it.
