## Why I built this

A still desktop picture is a waste of a good screen. But most of the live
wallpaper apps I tried came with a catch. Usually a subscription, or a Pro tier
holding the good wallpapers hostage.

Most of them are Electron apps wrapping a web page. They sit at 300 to 400 MB of
RAM and keep your CPU warm all day, for a picture that moves.

## What Muro does

Muro is a native macOS app that plays looping video wallpapers on every display,
and lets you browse them in a full screen gallery. It's written in Swift and
SwiftUI, hands video decoding to your Mac's media hardware instead of the CPU,
and pauses itself the moment you can't see it.

Everything is free. No Pro tier, no paywall, no license key, no account. Every
wallpaper and every feature is unlocked.

---

## Features

- 🌙 **Live video wallpapers.** Looping, seamless, on every display at once.
- 🔒 **Lock screen live wallpapers.** Play a wallpaper on your lock screen too, not just the desktop. Set it to the desktop, the lock screen, or both, on every display. Requires macOS 26 or newer.
- 🖥️ **Screen saver.** Muro can be your screen saver as well, playing video rather than a still picture, and you set how long your Mac waits before it starts. Requires macOS 26 or newer.
- 🪶 **Very low CPU usage.** HEVC decoded in hardware, never on the CPU.
- 😴 **Pauses itself** on full screen apps, display sleep, screen lock, Low Power Mode and low battery. A paused wallpaper uses no CPU at all.
- 🖱️ **Play only on desktop.** Hold the wallpaper still while you work and let it play when the desktop is clear, one screen at a time.
- ⚡ **Smooth or Efficient.** Keep a wallpaper's original frame rate, or drop it to 30 fps to halve the power draw. Your choice, per wallpaper.
- 🖼️ **Explore gallery.** Browse the catalog, preview full screen, download only what you want.
- 🧊 **Wallpaper Engine scenes.** Download Scene and Video wallpapers from the Steam Workshop and play them on your Mac: layers, effects, particles and parallax, rendered live on Metal. Needs a Steam account that owns Wallpaper Engine.
- 🌐 **More sources.** Browse and download from the Steam Workshop, MotionBGs and Wallper right inside Explore.
- 🔄 **New wallpapers arrive on their own.** The library updates without updating the app. More on that below.
- 📃 **Playlists.** Rotate through a set on a timer, shuffled or in order.
- ⏱️ **Automations.** Give every wallpaper its own time. Ten seconds each, or a full day schedule where each wallpaper has its own hours.
- ⏸️ **Pause after a set time.** Let a wallpaper play for a while after it changes or after you unlock, then hold still. Set it in seconds, minutes or hours, for everything or for one wallpaper, and turn on Replay on Clear Desktop to get that time again whenever your desktop is clear.
- 🗑️ **Delete what you do not want.** Remove wallpapers one at a time or several at once, imported videos included.
- 📥 **Import your own.** Drop in any video and it gets transcoded once to HEVC and added to your library.
- 🎛️ **Menu bar controls.** Play, pause, skip and switch wallpapers without opening the app.
- ✨ **Tells you when there is a new Muro.** What's New shows what changed in the release and downloads it for you.
- 💾 **Space control.** See what each wallpaper costs on disk, and remove downloads you're done with.
- 🆓 **Free and open source** (MIT).

> Requires macOS 14 (Sonoma) or newer. The build is universal, so it runs on
> both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. Lock screen and screen saver wallpapers
> need macOS 26 or newer. On macOS 26 and later the interface uses SwiftUI's
> native liquid glass; on older versions it falls back to translucent
> materials, which looks slightly different but works the same.

## Install

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask MrRockySL/muro/muro
```

### Manual download

1. Download the latest DMG from the [Releases](../../releases/latest) page.
2. Open it and drag Muro into your Applications folder.

On first launch, let it through macOS security. Muro is free and self signed
rather than carrying a paid Apple notarised certificate, so macOS blocks the
first launch with a *"can't be opened… Apple could not verify it is free of
malware"* warning. To get past it:

1. Double click the app once, then close the warning.
2. Open System Settings, go to Privacy & Security, scroll down to the message
   about Muro, and click **Open Anyway**, then **Open** to confirm.
3. On older macOS, you can right click the app instead, then pick Open twice.

Open Explore, pick a wallpaper, hit Apply. Done.

> Muro keeps running in your menu bar after you close the window. That's what
> keeps your wallpaper playing. Use the menu bar icon to control it, or Quit to
> stop it.

## Set it and forget it

Muro can change your wallpaper for you, two different ways.

**On a timer.** Pick a set of wallpapers, give each one a length, and Muro
cycles through them. Ten seconds each, or an hour each, whatever suits. Every
change is a crossfade, never a black flash.

**By the clock.** Give each wallpaper its own hours instead. Something calm for
the morning, something else after dark. The day is drawn as a 24 hour timeline
you drag, so you can see the whole thing at a glance rather than typing times
into boxes.

Only one runs at a time, and you can start or stop either from the menu bar
without opening the app.

---

## Let it play, then let it rest

A moving wallpaper is lovely for a minute and distracting for an hour.

**Pause after** lets a wallpaper play for a set time after it changes or after
you unlock your Mac, then hold still on a frame. Set it in seconds, minutes or
hours. It applies to everything by default, and any single wallpaper can
override it or opt out entirely.

A held frame costs no CPU at all, so this is the lightest Muro ever gets while
still showing you something you chose.

---

## Moving when you are looking, still when you are not

Most of the day your wallpaper sits behind windows, where you barely see it.

**Play only on desktop** holds a screen's wallpaper on a frame while any app
window is open on that screen, and plays it the moment the desktop is clear.
Minimise everything, or click the desktop, and it moves. Each display decides
for itself, so a window on your laptop screen leaves your monitor playing. Turn
it on in Settings, under Energy.

**Replay on Clear Desktop** sits right under Pause After. Every time your
desktop is clear again, Pause After counts from the beginning, so the wallpaper
plays for that long and then holds.

Both are off by default.

---

## Your screen saver too

On macOS 26 or newer, Muro can be your screen saver as well, playing the video
rather than a still picture. Open a wallpaper, pick **Screensaver** in the apply
card, and set it.

Settings also has **Start Screen Saver**, so you can choose how long your Mac
waits before it begins without opening System Settings. macOS keeps one screen
saver for the whole Mac, so this is one setting rather than one per display.

---

## Your library, your rules

Every wallpaper in your Library has a delete button, and you can select several
and clear them together. Videos you imported yourself can go too, which was not
possible before 3.0.

Nothing is ever deleted without asking first, and deleting a wallpaper cleans up
everything that pointed at it: playlists, automations, and the lock screen.

---

## Muro tells you when there is a new version

When a new Muro is released, the What's New button in the top bar picks it up on
its own. You get a dot on the button and a small note saying an update is
available.

Open it and you see what actually changed in that release, read straight from
the release itself, with a button that downloads the new version for you. The
notes for the version you are already running sit underneath.

---

## New wallpapers arrive on their own

You never have to update the app to get new wallpapers.

Muro re-reads its online catalog every time it launches or comes to the front,
so anything newly published shows up in your Explore tab within about a minute.
This works on every install that already exists, including older versions.

Videos only download when you pick one, and you can remove them again from the
Library tab whenever you want the space back.

---

## Wallpaper Engine, MotionBGs and Wallper

Explore has a source switcher at the top. **Muro** is the catalog above. The
other three are outside sources, and whatever you download from them becomes an
ordinary wallpaper in your Library: playlists, automations, Pause After and
deleting all work the same.

**Steam Workshop.** Search Wallpaper Engine's Workshop, filter to Scene or
Video wallpapers, or paste a Workshop link. Downloads go through DepotDownloader,
an open source Steam client Muro fetches once when you press **Set Up**, and
they need a Steam account that owns Wallpaper Engine. Sign in with your account
name, and type the password when Steam asks, or scan a QR code with the Steam
app. Muro never stores the password.

Video items play like any other video. Scene items are rendered live by Muro's
scene engine, on the desktop and in the full screen preview: image layers, the
effect chain, particles and mouse parallax. Text and web objects, and a few
particle behaviours, are not drawn yet. Some scenes use Wallpaper Engine's own
stock textures, which Muro does not ship; Settings, **Wallpaper Engine**, **Show
Folder** is where to copy them from your own install.

**Scenes are early days.** Wallpaper Engine's scene format is not documented
and this support was reverse engineered, so treat it as a beta. A scene may
look wrong, may be missing an effect, or may not render at all. Some scenes
also need Wallpaper Engine's own built-in textures, which Muro does not ship:
if one looks incomplete, copy those from your own install into Settings →
Wallpaper Engine → Show Folder. Text, clock and web objects, some particle
behaviours and sprite trails are not drawn yet. Plain video wallpapers, from
the Workshop or anywhere else, are not affected by any of this.

A scene plays on the desktop only. The lock screen and the screen saver are
drawn by macOS from a video.

Some wallpapers carry their own sound: a scene's audio layer, or a video with
an audio track. Muro keeps that audio and stays silent anyway, until you turn
**Wallpaper Sound** on in Settings. It follows the picture, so a wallpaper that
is paused, covered or locked away makes no noise.

You can also drop a Wallpaper Engine item folder, one with a `project.json`,
onto the Library.

**MotionBGs** and **Wallper.** Free looping wallpapers, downloaded as video,
MotionBGs in HD or 4K and searchable, Wallper by category.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MrRockySL/Muro.git
cd Muro/Muro
./build-app.sh --install     # builds, bundles, signs, installs to /Applications
```

Forgot `--recurse-submodules`? `./build-app.sh` and `scripts/build-scene-engine.sh`
both notice `Muro/SceneEngine` is empty and run `git submodule update --init`
for you — but its own repository is currently private, so that step needs
access to it.

`./build-app.sh --dmg` also produces `dist/Muro-<version>.dmg`.

The Wallpaper Engine scene engine is Rust, so building needs
[rustup](https://rustup.rs) with both Mac targets
(`rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin`). `build-app.sh`
builds it for you. For `swift build` or `swift test` on their own, build it
first with `scripts/build-scene-engine.sh`. See
[`Muro/SceneEngine/README.md`](Muro/SceneEngine/README.md).

The package builds MuroKit, which holds the shared engine and library code, the
app itself, and a handful of command line tools (`muro-engine`, `muro-import`,
`muro-set`, `muro-prepare` and `muro-publish`) that read the same config and
library files as the app.

---

## How it works

Muro is native the whole way down: Swift, SwiftUI and AVFoundation. No Electron,
no web views.

The wallpaper is a video playing in a window that sits just below your desktop
icons, decoded in hardware by your Mac's video engine, so the CPU barely
participates. The moment the wallpaper can't be seen, Muro pauses it, and a
paused wallpaper costs nothing.

A Wallpaper Engine scene is drawn in the same window by the scene engine, in
Rust on wgpu and Metal. A scene with nothing moving is drawn once; one with
animated effects or particles runs at 30 fps, and it stops under exactly the
same conditions a video pauses.
